# TL;DR
This is a container repo to take some Rust examples

* 01_kickoff - start project

# Some more words
This is some kind of a clone of the Python project I kicked-off for my son. I
am going to use the same approach to teach myself Rust


I thought about a way to teach coding. When I started back in the days it seems you only had to learn the language and that it was.
Today you have tons of tech, endless terms and finally a confusing environment, where it is hard to find the right point to start. A point easy enough to begin, but also open touch more complicated topics.

Since the receiver of that lessons is a great Wagner fan and totally "in love" with the Ring, I choose a initial setting from here.

## The idea
The related projects will implement some kind of a simulator of a dwarfs mine world. Where it is the goal to collect gems and gold and pile up a hoard.

## The didactic approach
Take the setting and implement it in every contained project. From project to project the complexity will be increased.
So it will teach Python, programming, algorithms (not the hard stuff) ... we will see where it ends.

Hopefully it will work out :D
